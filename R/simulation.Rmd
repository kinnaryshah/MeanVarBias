### GENERATING DATA
#question: is tau.sq 0 because there is no technical/nonspatial variance?
#question: where do i incorporate the length-scale parameter?

#1000 spots and 200 genes

  #150 genes will have sigma.sq = 0
  #50 genes will have sigma.sq randomly selected from a range 1 to 10 (this is ground truth of ranks)

  #all genes will have nonzero beta values

  #150 genes will have beta values randomly selected from a range 1 to 100
  #25 of the 50 genes will have beta values randomly selected from a range 1 to 10
  #25 of the 50 genes will have beta values randomly selected from a range 50 to 100

#we now have beta and sigma.sq values for each gene
#calculate lambda values by exp(beta+sigma.sq)
#use rpois() to simulate 1000 values per gene

### USING THE DATA
#run nnSVG on the logcounts matrix

#run weighted nnSVG on the logcounts matrix

### EXPLORING CHANGING RANKS
#prop sv, sigma.sq, LR pre weighting, LR post weighting, etc.
